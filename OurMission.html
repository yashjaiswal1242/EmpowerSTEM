        <h2>The Importance of STEM Beyond the Classroom
        </h2>
        <p>
            The value of STEM education is universally recognized, and fortunately, more students gain access to STEM-focused learning opportunities in schools every year. However, these experiences often stop at the classroom door. Many young people don’t envision themselves as future innovators or engineers and rarely engage with STEM actively outside of school.
        </p>

        <p> 
            But STEM is so much more than just science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It fosters creativity, critical thinking, resilience, and collaboration—skills that are invaluable no matter the career path a student chooses to follow.

        </p>
        <p>
            At EmpowerSTEM, we’re changing the narrative by connecting students to STEM in a way that feels approachable and engaging. Our program is built on peer-to-peer outreach: students inspiring and teaching other students. By removing the traditional barriers of adult-led instruction, we create a fun, supportive environment where participants can see themselves as problem-solvers and innovators, sparking a lifelong interest in STEM.
